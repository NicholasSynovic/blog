## I'm Not Mad, Just Disappointed

I am an undergraduate studying Computer Science at Loyola University Chicago. I will be graduating in the Spring of 2022 and will go back to Loyola to get my Master's in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning and AI.

I've been able to attend Loyola with a scholarship. I've succeeded in all of my classes. I've earned awards and grants for research. I've won department competitions. I've applied for and gotten jobs within the Computer Science Department. And currently, I'm leading the CS Department's research laboratory with other faculty.

That was only a fraction of my resume that Loyola has directly contributed. I've been fortunate enough to be offered opportunities based on my hard work and merit. I feel like the university has my back going forward. At the end of it all, I love my school because of what it has done for me and for how it has rewarded me for what I have done for it.

So why don't I feel ready to graduate?

After all, everything about the past four years of my life has been to prepare me for entering the job force. All of the classes, tests, projects, internships, research experiences, and more are leading to that moment where I go and do what I've been trained to do. But as I sit here and write this, I can't help but feel that I haven't been taught or even understand the breadth of the field that I'm entering. It feels like now, after four years, I'm only starting to peek over the ledge of the abyss that are the fields of Software Engineering and Computer Science.

Why do I feel this way? I shouldn't feel this way; I've done so much already! Why is it that when I'm finally preparing to leave university and start my life I feel like I know less than when I went in?

The easy answer is pacing. Not of myself, or the university, but of business. Business doesn't wait. Businesses are constantly trying new things, creating new products, training, and expecting more from their employees. The pace of business doesn't slow down or wait. It accelerates. And if universities don't keep up with business, the pacing of what is being taught in classrooms versus what is expected in the real world won't align.

Now that isn't to say that universities are teaching outdated methods and techniques or that going to university is a bad idea. **I love what my university has taught me as I think that what I have learned are essential building blocks to success**. But what I'm saying is that my education can only go so far. That now more than ever students are expected to have a greater depth of understanding of the field that they're entering than they could've ever possibly understood four years ago.

I'm not mad that I've come to this realization. I'm just disappointed that it took me this long.

## My Thesis Statement

So what? Time to fold in and give up? Become a botanist in India to escape the mound of debt looming over my head?

That isn't me. I'm going to dig in and weather this storm. I'm going to become smarter, work harder, think ahead and ask, "What next?". Not to fanboy over the future technologies, but so that I can learn them before they are mainstream. So that when the time comes, I'm the top choice for employment or a promotion, or to lead a project, or whatever.

And I'm going to document this journey here.

Not to brag or to demonstrate my superior knowledge, but so that others who read this can see where and what businesses are racing towards and get in front of it.

This blog is going to become my home for sharing projects and ideas, thoughts and experiences, best practices, and more on technologies that I discover businesses demanding.

## How Then?

How then am I going to start? Hell, how could you start?

It's honestly not that difficult. Look at job postings from top companies.

Look for what they are requiring individuals to know on a technical level. Look for what technologies they are expecting you to know and what you don't know. Look for the interpersonal requirements as those often matter just as much or even more. And understand what they are expecting of you. Because if you can understand and match what Amazon, Google, Meta, Twitter, Netflix, etc. is asking for, then you can apply that same knowledge and understanding to any second or third-tier tech company.

I'm going to write blogs here about me applying for jobs. Sounds boring, but I'm going to ask you to look at this as almost a Rocky training montage. There is a seemingly insurmountable goal that I want to achieve and I need to train my whole self to do so.

When phrased like that, how could you not read some guy's blog on technology?
