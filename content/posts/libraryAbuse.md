> Libraries are the best institute to abuse for your benefit. And they encourage it!

## Do You Have a Library Card?

... and is it active? Serously, go find it and try to log into your library account online (if your library supports it).
And even if you can't find it, go to your local libraries website right now!
Because holy crap, do they offer some amazing deals.

And when I say deals, I really mean *free shit*.
Particularly, *expensive shit* that they offer for **free** (sorta).

Oh, and it's all online.
So since you're reading this, there is literally no reason why you couldn't access this content and start becoming a more informed individual, or at least having more diverse options for reading.

## What's The Catch?

I have said and will keep saying that the content that your library offers to you is *free*.
But libraries don't actually provide *free shit* for free.
Someone, somewhere, had to buy each book in your library.
This/ these individual(s) also had to buy all of the other multimedia.
And this/ these individual(s) also have to keep the light's on in your library.

These individuals that cover this cost is typically you and your community via your tax dollars.
As libraries are typically government institutions created to help provide education opportunities for all, local, state, and the national government provide funding to libraries to cover expenses and to provide new opportunities for the community.
This funding comes from your tax dollars at the end of the day.
So if the government is operating right, then a portion of the taxes that you pay every year to the government goes towards providing "free" eduction opportunities at your local libraries.

That's the catch.
Nothing is free.
You bought it.

Which raises the question: Why aren't you using it?

## Aren't Libraries Just For Texts?

Yes, about 50 years ago.

However, people soon realized that knowledge of music or movies is often times just as important as textual knowledge.
So libaries have started to add music and movie offerings to their catalouges.
Some of the cool libraries even offer video games these days.

## So... Do Libraries Only Offer Online Offerings of Their Physical Contents?

> In other words, would a library's online catalouge be the exact same or worse than their physical offerings?

Thankfully, no.
Libraries these days should offer more online texts and content than what they could physically offer.
This is possible through the magic of the internet.
As well as subscribing to online versions of newspapers, streaming services, and other databases of information.

By subscribing to these different services, the library is given a portal to which any card carrying member can access a service's information for *free*.
Allowing you to access content that is restricted behind a paywall.
And good content too.

My library offers *The Great Courses*, *TIMES Magazine*, *Scientific American*, audiobooks, a wide range of e-books, documentaries, scholarly journals and articles, local, national, and global newspapers, and educational tools to anyone that signs up for *free*.
If I were to go and subscribe to each one of the above services, or start manually tracking down places online where I can get this content for free illegally, I would be incurring an extreme cost.
But thanks to the taxes that you and your community pay, your local library is able to take some of that money and apply it to providing educational opportunities for everyone in your community and abroad.

## The Take Away

The take away is simple: libraries are no longer physical.

Yes, there is a building that you can go to and actually check out a book, or movie, or whatever physically.
You can then take that and take care of it for the two to four weeks that you are alloted with it and return it.
If that's your jam, then this article wasn't for you.

But for the rest of us who want to maximize our usage of our local government's institutions, then today's libraries, with all of the subscriptions that they sign up for on your community's behalf, provide unprecidented access to information that is both free (again sorta) and accessible.
I strongly encourage you to visit your local library's website and see what *Online Services* they offer.
If they don't offer any, or not enough, look at the nearest largest city's library system and see if you can sign up for an online only account.
My city allows anyone to do this for free, allowing literally anyone to sign up and get access to their *Online Services* immediately.

As someone who values education and personal growth on a moral level, I strongly encourage you to check out what your local library is offering today.
Abuse their online offerings to your heart's content.
Because after all, you paid for it.

And hey, if you're feeling generous, donate or volunteer there.
I'm sure that they would appreciate it.
