## You Don't Know What You Don't Know

"You don't know what you don't know" is a quote that I heard a lot from my Dad
when growing up. As a child, I had no idea what this meant and never really
thought about it. However, as I'm now focussing this blog on getting a job in
tech, this quote now makes sense to me.

The idea behind the quote is that if you draw a circle around what you know or
feel like you know, then draw a larger circle around that one and shade in the
area of it (minus the inner circle), then that shaded area is everything that
you don't know. I think the graphic below sums it up nicely.

The point is that there is a whole lot of information out there that you
probably don't know anything about.

And that leads me to this post. I thought I knew a little bit about the tech
job hiring, but really I know nothing. So I did what any 20 something would do
when looking for a quick and easy way to learn and digest information, I went
to YouTube and searched for videos on how to get into the tech industry.
Luckily for me (and by extension, you), there are a lot of videos out there
covering this information.

To consolidate this information, I created a public YouTube playlist that you
can find
[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv2eYAalzbJfJ-piMG5DlQ74eeuN2gicb).
I intend to expand this playlist to include more videos in the future.

However, while watching these videos I found that information is repeated
quite a bit. To save some time for myself and for you, here is a list of the
top repeated information from each of the videos currently in the playlist:

1. Move to a larger/hub city

Larger or hub cities that attract companies typically have more job openings.
So if you live in a smaller area or tech jobs aren't a thing in your city, then
consider moving to a location that does offer the jobs that you want.

2. Market yourself and network

Get on "Tech Twitter" and contribute frequently. Market the work that you're
doing and become a positive face in the community. Also, don't just write
"Good job" or other generic posts *all the time*. Branch out and post memes or
opinions. Just be ready to justify your memes or opinions if someone disagrees.

3. Contribute to GitHub projects

Show that you can develop on a wide arrange of projects. Contribute to others'
work and make substantial progress there as well as create your own projects.
They don't have to be successful or big-name projects to be meaningful
(but if they are, the better it looks on your resume).

4. Grind hard

There is a lot of competition out in this space. Differentiate yourself by
learning more about the technologies that are going to be used in your job or
other aspects of your field. Be prepared to compete against everyone because
everyone wants the same job.

5. Make sure you are a fit for the company

Make sure that you align with the companies mission, morals, and job offerings.
If you hate the company that you work at, then you're not going to succeed in
the long term.

6. Apply to many jobs

Similar to \#4. Accept the fact that there is a large incoming workforce of
tech-centric individuals who want the same job as you. Be prepared to compete
against them for the position that you want.
