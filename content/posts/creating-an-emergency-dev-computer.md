## I Have a Problem

I like to develop. Like a lot. To the point where when I go and relax, I
typically read books on the subject, watch videos and lectures about code, and
so forth. I realized this while I was on my Spring Break in Miami, drunk at a
bar, wishing that I wanted to code in the morning. But then I remembered that I
purposefully left my computer at home to avoid coding, got sad, downed my drink,
and then I was happy once again.

But now that I'm home, I realized that I can actually resolve this problem
permanently. And to do so, I'm going to create a development environment that
I will always have on me.

## Here's the Plan

I'm going to use some of my phone's storage space to hold an Ubuntu development
environment. I'm going to forgo a GUI to keep the project minimal. And as a
proof of concept, the following languages will be availible for me to develop
with:

* Python
* Java
* Node JS

Truthfully, I don't expect to use this development enviornment for anything
serious. But that's why I'm calling this an *emergency* development environment.
